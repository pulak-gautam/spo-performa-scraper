# SPO Performas' Scraper/Organizer
<hr>

## Description
This is a tool for filtering out companies through the pdf performas provided by the Students' Placement Cell (SPO). 
<br>
<br>

## Motivation/Need
SPO Portal organizes all the announcements and performas well, and is easy to navigate. It makes easy for students to look out for suitable companies, and roles open for their profile.
<br>
<br>
After every internship or placement season, SPO makes the performas (containing the job description & other details of a role offered by a company, all in a pdf file) of the companies which participated in the internship/placement season. The **organization of the performas is lost** and what the students are given is a zipped file containing pdf files which is **difficult to navigate**.

This was mostly created out of a personal need, since I was very frustrated through the task of scrounging through hundreds of pdf files and noting which were open for my branch/degree or profile.


## Functions
The most common use-case of **sorting out / listing companies according to branch/degree** has been automated through this tool.


## Future Plans
Currently, the tool only filters the performas/roles on the basis branch, and prints out it in an organized fashion on the terminal. 

It provides no extra information about the roles/companies. Thus, it can be modified to spit out more information such as stipend, location, etc. also.
